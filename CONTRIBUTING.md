# Contributing to Rhandum Townhall

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Rhandum Townhall** design archive.

This project welcomes community insight, discussion, and creative sparks while preserving **clear authorship boundaries** and a unified design vision.

---

## How Contributions Work

Contributions fall into **two primary categories**:

---

## 1. Discussion-Based Contributions

The **Discussion Boards** are the heart of community interaction.  
Anyone may freely comment:

- Ideas
- Balance suggestions
- Lore concepts
- Humor and thematic dialogue
- Feedback on existing proposals
- General conversation in **Community Gathering**

under deginated posts.

These discussions help guide the **direction, tone, and priorities** of future design work.

### Hall of Fame Recognition

Community members whose input inspires a mechanic, theme, or structural change will be credited in:

**`Rhandum_Townhall / Hall_of_Fame`**

This includes:

- Sources of inspiration
- Commenters who influenced concepts
- Memorable community contributions
- Notable participation, humor, or support

> Being listed in the Hall of Fame **does not transfer authorship or copyright**.  
> It is a recognition of influence and involvement, not ownership.

## 2. Formal Design Suggestions

If you want your idea considered for **integration into a future batch**, please submit it in the appropriate discussion channel:

- **Poets_of_Inspiration**  
  For new mechanics, systems, or creative concepts

- **Balance_Council**  
  For balance critiques, tuning suggestions, or mechanical analysis

- **Lore_Forge**  
  For lore concepts, worldbuilding, unit identities, and narrative flavor

### Please Include

- A clear description of the mechanic, critique, or lore idea
- Intended gameplay impact
- Constraints, risks, or synergy notes (if applicable)

### Possible Outcomes

Your submission may be:

- Accepted and adapted
- Reworked or merged with other ideas
- Declined (with explanation whenever possible)

**I read every comment.**

Ideas incorporated into final design notes will be credited in the **Rhandum_TownHall;Hall_of_Fame**.

---

## How Final Integration Works

To protect clarity and maintain a cohesive design vision:

- All merged designs are **authored, edited, and finalized** by the project creator
- Community ideas may **inspire or shape** mechanics, but final structure remains curated
- Rights to the final compiled designs remain with the creator under the repository license

---

## What Not to Submit

Please do **not** submit:

- Direct copyrighted text, art, or assets from **MY.GAMES**
- Reproductions of in-game files
- Requests to copy monetized features
- Personal attacks or low-effort spam
- Attempts to circumvent licensing terms

---

## How to Participate

You do **not** need GitHub experience.

You can:

- Post in Discussions
- React to threads
- Suggest ideas
- Offer balance analysis
- Ask questions
- Share inspiration
- Help with thematic flavor

Commenting under the **Reddit or Discord teaser posts** is also acceptable, although might be slower.

Everything helps.
