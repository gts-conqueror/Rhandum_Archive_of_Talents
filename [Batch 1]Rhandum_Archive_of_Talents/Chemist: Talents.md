Chemist

New variation called the “Principal investigator”

New variation called the “Lab Assistant”

1st Talent(Left): Enhance Reagent Prototype v1(Red): Introduces a new variant of chemist, “the principal investigator.” the highest mergerank chemist becomes the “ principal investigator” and stops attacking for 15s when conducting an experiment.After the experiment the chemist distributes the new potion to other chemists on the field which boost armor destruction by +5% for each chemists’ current value for another 15 seconds before the process is repeated again.

1st Talent(Right): Enhanced Reagent Prototype v2(Blue): Introduces a new variant of chemist, “the principal investigator.” The highest mergerank chemist becomes the “ principal investigator” and stops attacking for 17s when conducting an experiment.After the experiment the chemist distributes the new potion to other chemists on the field which gain the ability to slow down monsters by 5%  for another 15 seconds before the process is repeated again.


2nd Talent(Left): High Concentration:Principal investigations amour destruction/slowing effect  is boosted by an additional 2%

2nd Talent(Right):Conjugate Haste:Principal investigations brewing is reduced to 15s


3rd Talent (Left): Octet Rule: When the combined merge rank of chemists on the board is a multiple of 8, all units adjacent to a chemist increase critical chance by 1% and attack speed by two for every merge rank.(adds a sound effect once reached)

3rd Talent (Left): Redox Reaction: Dragging a Principal investigator onto a unit reduces it giving 1% additional crit chance for all units of a single type and increases attack speed by 5% for 40s  for that specific type of unit.After this this the Principal Investigator becomes “oxidated” disabling him from producing any Reagents for 15s after the reduction reaction is concluded(sound effect when reached)

Final Talent: De-localized Irrigation: (Introduces a new chemist, “the lab assistant”) which sets up 4 irrigation Hanging bars on the path . Irrigation bars will only become active for 15s  and cooldown for 25s.It can only secrete a reagent prototype. Effects from the irrigation system are enhanced by  40%.(each irrigation bar requires 1 wave to setup, lab assitant must be kept on the board till each bar is done or the progress of the bar will revert to naught)
