# Chemist

## Principal Variations
- **Principal Investigator** (*variant*)
- **Lab Assistant** (*variant*)

---

## 1st Talent

- **Left: Enhance Reagent Prototype v1 (Red)**
  - The highest merge rank Chemist becomes the "Principal Investigator."
  - The Principal Investigator stops attacking for 17s to conduct an experiment.
  - After the experiment: Distributes a new potion to other Chemists, boosting armor destruction by +5% for each Chemist's current value (15s duration).
  - This process repeats.

- **Right: Enhanced Reagent Prototype v2 (Blue)**
  - The highest merge rank Chemist becomes the "Principal Investigator."
  - The Principal Investigator stops attacking for 17s to conduct an experiment.
  - After the experiment: Distributes a new potion to other Chemists, who gain the ability to slow monsters by 5% (15s duration).
  - This process repeats.

## 2nd Talent

- **Left: High Concentration**
  - Principal Investigator’s armor destruction/slowing effect is boosted by an additional 2%.

- **Right: Conjugate Haste**
  - Principal Investigator's brewing time is reduced to 15s.

## 3rd Talent

- **Left: Octet Rule**
  - When the total combined merge rank of Chemists is a multiple of 8:  
    - All units adjacent to a Chemist increase critical chance by 1% and attack speed by 2 per merge rank.
      
    *Sound cues / animations to indicate reached threshold.*
    
    *Stack counter to show total combined mergerank.*

- **Right: Redox Reaction**
  - Dragging a Principal Investigator onto a unit of the same merge rank puts set unit in a "reduced" state, granting +1% crit chance for all units of that single type and increasing the specific unit's attack speed by 5% for 40s.
  - Afterward, the Principal Investigator becomes "oxidized," disabling the production of Reagents for 15s after the reaction.
   
   *Sound cues / animations to indicate Principal Investigator re-activation.*

## Final Talent

- **De-localized Irrigation**  
  Introduces the "Lab Assistant," who sets up 4 irrigation hanging bars on the path.
  - Bars become active for 15s, then cooldown for 25s.
  - Can only secrete a reagent prototype.
  - Effects from the irrigation system are enhanced by 40%.
  - *(Each bar takes 1 wave to set up. The Lab Assistant must remain on board until setup is complete, else progress is lost.)*
