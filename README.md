# Rhandum_Archive_of_Talents

*A curated codex of proposed talents and reincarnations for Rush Royale’s forgotten units—woven to restore rhythm, identity, and balance to the battlefield of Rhandum.*

---

## Project Overview

This repository presents a **talent and reincarnation proposal** for *Rush Royale*, focused specifically on **older and underutilized units** whose mechanical identity has faded over time.

Rather than rewriting core systems, these designs aim to restore relevance through **harmony, tempo control, and risk-weighted payoff**, preserving the game’s cadence while introducing new moments of decision, preparation, and counterplay.

Each system is written with **developer tunability** in mind. Percentages, durations, cooldowns, and thresholds are deliberately conservative and modular—*notes in a score, not a locked performance.*

---

## Design Intent

The guiding philosophy behind this project is simple:

- **No early-game dominance**  
  Power is earned through setup, positioning, hard decisions, and sacrifice.

- **Anti-spam by design**  
  Buffs, curses, and rituals require timing and commitment.

- **Every effect has a cost**  
  Silence before song. Restraint before crescendo.

Many mechanics are structured around **setup and delayed impact**, reinforcing a support-forward identity that rewards foresight rather than reaction.  
Effects unfold in **phases, not bursts**, allowing opponents time to read the play and respond—keeping balance intact in a fast-paced game.

---

## Scope and Structure

This project is released in **discrete batches**, each focusing on a small group of units (approximately five per batch).

Each unit entry includes:

- Base mechanic adjustments (where required for modern balance)
- Full left/right talent trees  
  *(including identity splits and symbolic alignment with Rhandum lore)*
- Reincarnation skills where thematically appropriate
- Explicit constraints to prevent abuse
- Clearly marked points where **developer discretion** is expected

Each batch is intended to be read as **a movement**, not a solo.

## Collaboration & Use

This work is shared as a:

- **Creative Systems Compendium**
- **Conceptual Design Portfolio**

It may serve as:

- A discussion piece for the player community
- A source of inspiration for future design passes
- A conceptual sketchbook for reimagining legacy unit systems

I am open to **discussion, feedback, and potential collaboration** with the *Rush Royale* development team or affiliated partners.

Community feedback submitted through **Rhandum Townhall discussions** may inspire future revisions.  
All final design decisions remain **curated and authored** within this repository.

## Final Note

These ideas are offered in good faith and with respect for the complexity of live game balance.  
They are not prescriptions—only melodies that could be cut, softened, or rearranged entirely.

If nothing else, let them stand as proof that **even older instruments can still shape the rhythm of the board**.
