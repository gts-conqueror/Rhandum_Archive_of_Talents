# Rhandum_Archive_of_Talents
A curated codex of proposed talents and reincarnations for Rush Royale’s forgotten units designs, woven to restore rhythm, identity, and balance to the battlefield of Rhandum.

Project Overview

This repository presents a community-designed talent and reincarnation proposal for Rush Royale, focused specifically on older and underutilized units whose mechanical identity has faded over time.
Rather than rewriting fundamentals, these designs aim to restore relevance through harmony, tempo control, and risk-weighted payoff preserving the game’s core cadence while introducing new moments of decision, preparation, and counterplay.
Each system is written with developer tunability in mind. Percentages, durations, cooldowns, and thresholds are deliberately conservative and modular, intended as notes in a score not a locked performance.

Design Intent

The guiding philosophy behind this project is simple:
No early-game dominance power is earned through setup, positioning, hard decisions and sacrifice
Anti-Spam Friendly; buffs, curses, and rituals require timing and commitment
Every effect has a cost; silence before song, restraint before crescendo
Many mechanics are structured around setup, and delayed impact, reinforcing a support identity that rewards foresight rather than reaction. Effects unfold in phases, not bursts allowing opponents time to read the play and respond, keeping things fair in such a fast paced game.

Scope and Structure

This project is released in discrete batches, each focusing on a small group of units(about 5 per batch).
Every unit includes:
Base mechanic adjustments (if required for modern balance)
Full talent trees with left/right (includes identity splits and symbolism for Rhandum lore)
Reincarnation skills where thematically appropriate
Clear constraints to prevent abuse
Explicit points where developer discretion is expected
Think of each section as a movement, not a solo meant to be read in context, not isolation.

Collaboration & Use

This work is shared as a “creative systems compendium” and a “conceptual design portfolio”.
It may serve as:
A discussion piece for the player community
A source of inspiration for future design passes
A conceptual sketchbook for reimagining units systems

I am open to discussion, feedback, and potential collaboration with the Rush Royale development team or affiliated partners.
Any deeper use, adaptation, or formal collaboration beyond public discussion should be initiated through direct contact.

Final Note

These ideas are offered in good faith and with respect for the complexity of live game balance.
They are not prescriptions, only melodies that could be cut, softened, or rearranged entirely.
If nothing else, let them remind us that even older instruments can still shape the rhythm of the board.
